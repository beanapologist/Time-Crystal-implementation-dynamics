# Time Crystal Proof of Stake (tcPoS)

A quantum-enhanced blockchain consensus mechanism that leverages time crystals for secure and efficient validation.

## What is tcPoS?

Time Crystal Proof of Stake (tcPoS) combines quantum mechanics with traditional proof of stake to create a more secure and efficient blockchain consensus mechanism. It uses quantum time crystals - systems that exhibit periodic behavior in their ground state - to achieve consensus.

## Key Components

### Quantum Layer
- **Quantum State**: The fundamental layer where network information is encoded in quantum states
- **Phase Synchronization**: Keeps validators aligned through quantum entanglement
- **Quantum Coherence**: Maintains system stability through quantum coupling (99.999% efficiency)

### Consensus Layer
- **Validator Pool**: Network of 20 active validators maintaining the blockchain
- **Block Time**: Ultra-fast 0.01 second blocks enabled by quantum speedup
- **Error Correction**: Advanced error threshold of 10^-10 for maximum security

### Economic Model
- **Staking**: Validators must stake tokens to participate
- **Rewards**: Distributed based on:
  - Quantum coherence contribution
  - Phase alignment accuracy
  - Active validation time
- **Slashing**: Penalties for:
  - Phase misalignment
  - Quantum decoherence
  - Validation failures

## Benefits

- **Speed**: Sub-second block times
- **Security**: Quantum-enhanced cryptography
- **Efficiency**: Lower energy consumption than traditional PoS
- **Scalability**: Automatic load balancing through quantum optimization

## How to Participate

1. Acquire the minimum stake requirement
2. Set up a validator node
3. Initialize quantum synchronization
4. Join the validator pool
5. Maintain phase alignment

## Technical Requirements

```json
{
    "minimum_stake": "100,000 tokens",
    "hardware": {
        "cpu": "64 cores",
        "ram": "128 GB",
        "storage": "2 TB NVMe",
        "quantum_processor": "Optional but recommended"
    },
    "network": "1 Gbps symmetric",
    "uptime": "99.9% required"
}
```

## Risks and Considerations

- **Quantum Decoherence**: Can lead to temporary validation inability
- **Phase Drift**: Requires regular synchronization
- **Hardware Requirements**: Higher than traditional PoS
- **Technical Complexity**: Advanced understanding needed

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/timecrystal/tcpos
cd tcpos
npm install
```

2. **Configure Node**
```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
# Edit config.json with your settings
```

3. **Initialize Validator**
```bash
npm run init-validator
npm run sync-quantum
npm run start
```
